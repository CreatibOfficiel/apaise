# Shipnative Starter Kit

Docs are the source of truth: https://docs.shipnative.app  
This README is only a fast quickstart.

## Recommended Quickstart
1) Clone the repo  
2) `yarn install`  
3) `yarn setup` (recommended to wire API keys before coding)  
4) First AI prompt: ask it to update the project readmes with your app's specifics so context stays accurate  
5) Start coding (recommended: add the Supabase MCP for local context)

More setup, deployment, and service details live in the docs.
