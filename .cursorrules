## ⚠️ SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

**CRITICAL**: This file references `AI_CONTEXT.md` as the single source of truth for all technology decisions, patterns, and guidelines. When in doubt, refer to `AI_CONTEXT.md` first.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Read AI_CONTEXT.md first** - This is the single source of truth for tech stack and patterns
2. **Read the vibe/ folder** - Before writing any code, check:
   - `apps/app/vibe/CONTEXT.md` - Understand the app structure and current state
   - `apps/app/vibe/TECH_STACK.md` - Know which technologies to use (and avoid)
   - `apps/app/vibe/STYLE_GUIDE.md` - Follow code conventions and patterns
   - `vibe/SERVICES.md` - Service architecture
   - `vibe/MOCK_SERVICES.md` - Mock mode guide

3. **Use existing components** - Check `/components` before creating new ones
4. **Follow established patterns** - Look at `STYLE_GUIDE.md` and `SCREEN_TEMPLATES.md`
5. **Update documentation** - Follow the documentation rules in `AI_CONTEXT.md`

## Technology Decisions

**See `AI_CONTEXT.md` for complete details.**

### ✅ ALWAYS USE
- **React Native Unistyles 3.0** for styling (NOT NativeWind/Tailwind)
- **React Navigation** for navigation (NOT Expo Router)
- **Zustand** for global state management
- **React Query** for data fetching and server state
- **TypeScript** with strict mode (no `any` types)
- **React Hook Form + Zod** for forms and validation
- **Functional components** only

### ❌ NEVER SUGGEST
- NativeWind/Tailwind
- Expo Router
- Redux, MobX, or Context API for new state
- Inline styles or hardcoded values
- useEffect for data fetching

## Styling & Code Style

**Refer to `apps/app/vibe/STYLE_GUIDE.md` for all styling patterns and code examples.**

Key Rules:
1. **Unistyles**: Always use `StyleSheet.create((theme) => ...)`
2. **Theme**: Never hardcode colors/spacing. Use `theme.colors.*` and `theme.spacing.*`.
3. **Dark Mode**: Automatic via semantic theme colors.
4. **Imports**: Standardized order (React -> Libs -> Stores -> Components).

## Documentation System

**Refer to `AI_CONTEXT.md` for the allowed root-level files and location rules.**

**Key Rule**: New features → `docs/` folder, NOT root directory. Only update existing root files.

## Mock Mode

The app supports running without API keys (mock mode). Ensure new features work in mock mode. See `vibe/MOCK_SERVICES.md`.
